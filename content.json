Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Information and Computing Science from the School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China. I interned at ZenusTech, working on physics-based simulation and high performance computing, advised by Xinxin Zhang and Xinlei Wang. My research interests include physics-based simulation, tatile perception and machine learning for robotics.
